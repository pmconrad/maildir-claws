    	<title>What's the Maildir++ Plugin?</title>
	<para>
	    The Maildir++ plugin for Claws Mail provides direct
	    access to Maildir++ Mailboxes used by IMAP-Servers
	    like <application>Courier-IMAP</application>,
	    <application>BincIMAP</application> or
	    <application>Dovecot</application> without having all the
	    IMAP overhead of a connection to 'localhost'.

	    Newer versions can work too. If you use a precompiled package,
	    you might have to install an additional development-package.

	<title>Install</title>
	<para>
	    Run the <command>configure</command> script. You need the
	    Claws Mail includes and pkg-config files that are usually
	    installed, when you install Claws Mail.
	</para>
	<para>
	    After the <command>configure</command> script you can
	    build the plugin with <command>make</command> and install
	    it with <command>make install</command>. It should install
	    plugins in the location where the other plugins are usually
	    <filename class="directory">$PREFIX/lib/claws-mail</filename>.
	    But you can load the plugin from any directory, also from the
	    <filename class="directory">src/.libs</filename> directory in
	    the source directory, if you don't want to install the plugin.
	</para>

	<title>Usage</title>
	<para>
	    The Maildir++ plugin consists
	    of 2 parts. A common plugin <filename
	    class="libraryfile">maildir.so</filename> and a Gtk+ plugin
	    <filename class="libraryfile">maildir_gtk.so</filename>. You
	    probably want to load both plugins also the common plugin
	    alone is enough to use a Maildir++ folder that is already
	    added in Sylpheed. But without the Gtk+ plugin you can not
	    add new Maildir++ folders in Sylpheed and the PopUp-menu
	    of the folder tree will only show you the common operations
	    that all folders support and not the operations that affect
	    the Maildir++ folder. So you probably want to load it too.
	</para>
	<para>
	    After you loaded the plugins you can add an existing or create
	    a new Maildir++ folder with the 'File/Add mailbox/Maildir++'
	    entry in the main menu. After that the folder should appear
	    in the folder tree and is useable just like any other folder.
	</para>
