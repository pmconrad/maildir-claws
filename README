1. What's the Maildir++ Plugin?

   The Maildir++ plugin for Claws Mail provides direct access to
   Maildir++ Mailboxes used by IMAP-Servers like Courier-IMAP,
   BincIMAP or Dovecot without having all the IMAP overhead of a
   connection to 'localhost'.
     __________________________________________________________

2. Requirements

     * Claws Mail 0.9.10claws48
     * Berkeley DB 4.1

   Newer versions can work too. If you use a precompiled package,
   you might have to install an additional development-package.
     __________________________________________________________

3. Install

   Run the configure script. You need the Claws Mail includes and
   pkg-config files that are usually installed, when you install
   Claws Mail.

   After the configure script you can build the plugin with make
   and install it with make install. It should install plugins in
   the location where the other plugins are usually
   $PREFIX/lib/claws-mail. But you can load the plugin from any
   directory, also from the src/.libs directory in the source
   directory, if you don't want to install the plugin.
     __________________________________________________________

4. Usage

   The Maildir++ plugin consists of 2 parts. A common plugin
   maildir.so and a Gtk+ plugin maildir_gtk.so. You probably want
   to load both plugins also the common plugin alone is enough to
   use a Maildir++ folder that is already added in Sylpheed. But
   without the Gtk+ plugin you can not add new Maildir++ folders
   in Sylpheed and the PopUp-menu of the folder tree will only
   show you the common operations that all folders support and not
   the operations that affect the Maildir++ folder. So you
   probably want to load it too.

   After you loaded the plugins you can add an existing or create
   a new Maildir++ folder with the 'File/Add mailbox/Maildir++'
   entry in the main menu. After that the folder should appear in
   the folder tree and is useable just like any other folder.

5. ToDo

   Things that still have to be completed:

     * Automatic updating of folder contents, when changed by
       other program
