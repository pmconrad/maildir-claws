# Maildir++ Plugin for Claws Mail

The Maildir++ plugin for [Claws Mail](https://claws-mail.org/) provides direct access to Maildir++ Mailboxes used by IMAP-Servers like Courier-IMAP, BincIMAP or Dovecot without having all the IMAP overhead of a connection to 'localhost'.

## Note

Original plugin version is available at http://claws-mail.org/snapshots/plugins/maildir-0.24.4cvs18.tar.gz

This repository is not so much an attempt to revive the plugin and keep it in a well-maintained state, but more of an effort to keep it from dying. The primary focus, therefore, is to keep it compilable and usable with the latest versions of Claws Mail and recent versions of the required libraries.

## Warning

I'm neither familiar with UI development in general nor with the development of Claws Mail plugins, nor with GTK development.
